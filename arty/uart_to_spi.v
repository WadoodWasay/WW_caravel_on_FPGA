/* This version of simpleuart taken from picosoc (picorv32) and modified
 * for operation as a module sitting between the FTDI chip on the Arty A7
 * board and the Caravel housekeeping SPI, translating from UART protocol
 * to SPI and vice versa, because the Arty A7 board does not connect pins
 * from the FTDI other than UART Tx and Rx, making a direct connection to
 * SPI impossible.
 *
 * UART format is:  1 start bit (0), 8 data bits, 1 stop bit (1)
 *
 * 2nd pass at this module.  Noting that a 1-byte delay is acceptable
 * since the return data may arrive at any time relative to the outbound
 * data (because the UART is full-duplex and the input and output bits
 * don't have to be in lockstep like they are with only the SPI).  Using
 * the delay to save the contents of a full byte on one side, the bits
 * are flipped between the UART protocol (lsb first) and SPI protocol
 * (msb first).
 *
 * To deal with the CSB line, CSB is assumed to be held low for the
 * duration of a transmission.  Then end of transmission is determined
 * by the lack of additional outgoing data, which is defined as the
 * time span equivalent to N bytes, without another start bit.
 *
 * In the worst case, N may have to be set very high to cover delays in
 * the output, and any driving program will have to add pauses to force
 * the CSB to go high to end a transmission.
